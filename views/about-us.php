            <h3>Our start</h3>
            <p>Cape Medics was founded in 2004 by Ozayr Vally an advanced life support practitioner with over 15 years of experience in Emergency Services, Medical, Rescue, Military and Remote Site Medical Support environments.</p>

            <p>After serving in both the South African Navy and Military Health Services. Here he was responsible for the outfitting and training of Medical Staff destined for the frigates and submarines that the SANDF had acquired.</p>

            <p>Vally resigned his position in the SANDF as one of only five qualified Advanced Life Support Practitioners but is still involved in the military environment and still has close ties to several departments in the military.</p>

            <p>Vally identified a clear need for a fresh take on EMS, Fire, Rescue and Safety services supplying the film and television industry in South Africa.</p>

            <h3>Our philosophy</h3>
            <p>Cape Medics has engendered a philosophy and work ethos that is unrivalled in South Africa. Our Medical Staff are trained to the highest standards and are kept up to date with the latest evidence based treatment modalities.</p>

            <p>Our Set Medics are all experienced operational medics with a required time spent in an EMS environment before being utilised on set. A mentorship program ensures that every Set Medic has some supervised experience of a film set and understands the unique environments and challenges that a film set presents, this means that they are also familiar with set etiquette and proper behaviour on set, thus ensuring a pro-active and always ready medic who understands their job on set.
